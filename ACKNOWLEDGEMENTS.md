There are several inspirations for this software that are acknowledged here.

The hash table, hash list, linked list and CONTAINER\_OF macro are inspired by
Linux kernel. It is believed that since ideas cannot be copyrighted, this does
not make the independent implementations copyrighted by Linux kernel copyright
holders.

Rebalancing of the AVL tree and the red-black tree is partially based on
pseudocode obtained from Wikipedia. Mersenne Twister is based on programming
ideas taken from the official implementation. SipHash is based on the official
implementation under public domain. ChaCha is based on some existing
implementation, but however, I am unable to find out which and do not remember
anymore. MurMurHash is based on C code obtained from Wikipedia. It is believed
that in most jurisdictions, these would belong to permitted citation rights
and/or fair use, but commercial users of this software are advised to carefully
obtain legal advice from a lawyer.

Some IP fragment reassembly code has been directly obtained from Linux kernel
and DPDK. This makes them copyrighted by the original authors, as well. The
same is true for the skip list based implementation of timers, obtained from
DPDK, and a SHA-1 implementation, obtained from Linux kernel.
